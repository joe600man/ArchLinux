# ArchLinux
Helpful documentation for using Arch linux, from useful commands to how to guides
This document will grow with time as I build it out and update it. General format will be Maglinks to sections which will contain manifests of the sections of the repository for quick reference.
The general idea is that I will create folders for different subjects, such as:
  1. Useful Commands
  2. How to guides
  3. Dotfiles
  4. Management strategies
  5. Scripts and Programs
